### Hi, I'm Biogitte ðŸ‘‹

### About me
**Background:** I'm a molecular biologist that fell in love with computers.
**Journey:** It started out with some stressed copepods in a lab - and some old fashioned calculations in Excel of, mostly qPCR data. Then I realised what could be done with code, so I started to learn to code and became a bioinformatician exploring stress responses in copepods using RNA sequencing. Then I explored the world as a data manager in a research group that focused on type II diabetes. I found the analysis of data much more fun, so they let me help out with their bioinformatics, machine learning and other analytics tasks. Now, I am a team lead/project lead in a Danish agency within the health sector.
